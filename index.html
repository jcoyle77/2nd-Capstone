    <h5> Dafran </h5>
    <p> I really enjoyed my experience with "Rank Up"! I've played the game Counterstrike: Global Offensive
      on and off, but when Riot Games recently released their new FPS called Valorant, I wanted to try this new game.
      I was decent at it, but I realized there was still a lot that I could improve in. So, when I found out about Rank Up,
      I was very excited about finding the opportunity I'd been looking for. The coach that I worked with was "Dafran".
      His expertise in the FPS, or first person shooter genre of games was extremely helpful.
      One of the first things he reccomended was to lower my mouse sensitivty, since hitting the targets
      requires keen precision. This required me to get a larger than average mouse mat, but when I did this
      I did indeed see a large improvement in my aim and accuracy. Additionally, he also reccomended
      and aim trainer called "Kovaak 2.0". It has many different aim drills for improving accuracy. By doing
      this every day for however much I can tolerate, whether its 15 minutes or an hour, etc, my aim has been improving significantly.
      I plan to continue practicing what Dafran taught me. I'm very satisified with the service he provided through Rank Up!

     </p>
     <h5> Sodapoppin </h5>
    <p> I have played the MMO World of Warcraft casually on and off for about five years now. I struggled to achieve
      a high rank in pvp (player vs player). That's when I found out about Rank Up! I enlisted Sodapoppin's services,
      and he taught me how to have more mastery over the class I play. Sodapopping has been playing World of Warcraft for
      roughly fifteen years. His vast knowledge of the game, and how each class plays, etc. has made him a very good coach.
      He taught me the optimal rotations (which of my classes abilities to use when), how to break line of sight on an enemy
      by taking advantage of moving behind pillars when they try to attack me. He taught me to interupt their abilities near
      the end to avoid being faked out by a cast that they might cancel.
      </p>
    <h5> XQC </h5>
    <p> I have played the FPS called "Overwatch" for two years now. When I started playing, my skill rating was around
      mid-tier. I was happy not to be terrible at the game, but at the same time I wished to achieve a higher rank.
      I tried many things on my own, but none of these things really achieved tangible results. Until recently, when I found
      out about this website called Rank Up. I found that they offered coaching for Overwatch, from former pro players no less.
      He has achieved a rank among the top 500 players in the North American region. He advised that I lower my in-game sensitivty,
      which makes my aim more accurate. He also taught me when to engage on team fights, and when to back out and regroup with
      my other team members.
